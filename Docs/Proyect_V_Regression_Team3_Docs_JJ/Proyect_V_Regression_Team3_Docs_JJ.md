## 🐾 PET ADOPTION PREDICTOR

### Project Overview

This project aims to build a Machine Learning system capable of predicting how many days an animal will stay in a shelter before being adopted (TimeInShelterDays). The prediction is based on various features such as physical traits, adoption history, and health condition.

### File: pet_adoption_data.csv

### Records: 2,007

### Main Features

- PetType — Type of animal
- Breed — Breed of the pet

- AgeMonths — Pet’s age in months

- WeightKg — Weight in kilograms

- Vaccinated — Whether the pet has been vaccinated

- HealthCondition — Current health status

- AdoptionFee — Adoption cost

- PreviousOwner — Indicates if the pet had a previous owner

The resulting model will help animal shelters optimize their adoption strategies by identifying pets at higher risk of long shelter stays. This will allow shelters to improve adoption rates and manage resources more efficiently.
