# 🐾 PET ADOPTION PREDICTOR

### Project Overview
This project aims to build a **Machine Learning system** capable of predicting how many days an animal will stay in a shelter before being adopted (`TimeInShelterDays`).  
The prediction is based on various features such as physical traits, adoption history, and health condition.

### Dataset
- **File:** `pet_adoption_data.csv`  
- **Records:** 2,007  
- **Main Features:**
  - `PetType` — Type of animal
  - `Breed` — Breed of the pet
  - `AgeMonths` — Pet’s age in months
  - `WeightKg` — Weight in kilograms
  - `Vaccinated` — Whether the pet has been vaccinated
  - `HealthCondition` — Current health status
  - `AdoptionFee` — Adoption cost
  - `PreviousOwner` — Indicates if the pet had a previous owner

### Purpose
The resulting model will help **animal shelters** optimize their adoption strategies by identifying pets at higher risk of long shelter stays.  
This will allow shelters to improve adoption rates and manage resources more efficiently.
